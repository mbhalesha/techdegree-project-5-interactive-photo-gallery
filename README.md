# My Techdegree Project 5: Interactive Photo Gallery

For this project, I created an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and jQuery. I utilized mockups as well as thumbnails and photos provided to me. The photos filter in real-time as the user types and displays photos that match the search. The layout is responsive and includes the Lightbox 2 Plugin.
